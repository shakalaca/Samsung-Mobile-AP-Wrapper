If I want to use Mobile AP on i9000, from Launcher I have to:
1. Press menu key
2. Select Settings
3. Select Wireless and network
4. Select Mobile AP settings
5. Check/Uncheck Mobile AP

By using this application, I can have a short cut on desktop and
1. Press icon
2. Check/Uncheck Mobile AP

That's it !
